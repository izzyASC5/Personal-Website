<p class="History" id="bio">
    Hi, I'm Izzy. I'm all about having fun, helping others and living life to the fullest. While I am hardworking and dedicated, I love to have a great time. 
    I love ziplining, swimming, white water rafting and pretty much every kind of outdoor activity. I also LOVE being around others. I'm always laughing and am easy to get along with.
    As a first generation African American young man, I feel I have a responsibility to make the most of being born in the greatest country in the world.
    Being the child of immigrants, I aprreciate how lucky I am to live in a country where I am free to follow my dreams and am fortunate enough to have so many resources.
    I plan to do just that! I will always work hard and do my best. I will become a master coder, a fantastic husband and a loving father. For now, I am a great friend, hardworking student and dedicated brother.
    I love being around others. I am helpful, kind and non-judgemental. I'm happy to help. If ever need someone to listen, I'm here. Thanks for taking 
    the time to visit my wbesite.

        <h2 class="titles">My Story</h2>
        <p class="text" id ="Mystory"> 
            Life threw me a few curveballs along the way to becoming a confident, compassionate young man who loves his family, children, science, academic and helping those in need. 
            I had a relatively carefree childhood; making friends came easy to me, and I enjoyed my schoolwork and home life. 
            However, during my early teen years, I entered into a period of shy, awkward self-doubt. 
            I felt alienated, out of place, and uncertain of just about everything in my world. 
            I didn’t seem to fit in anywhere. 
            Although my mother is African, because my complexion is a little lighter, I was told that I wasn’t “Black” enough. 
            Conversely, my caucasion colleagues felt I was too “black”. This led to the inevitable teasing from classmates and, occasionally, bullying. 
            My grades slipped, I became withdrawn and I avoided socializing. Eventually, I lost interest in going to school. 
            During this stage of my life, my grandfather became seriously ill and my mother, already busy working a full-time job on top of raising my three younger siblings and I, had to somehow find time to care for her father. 
            Unimaginably, this trying time became almost unbearable when my mother was involved in a car accident resulting in serious injuries that resulted in her becoming physically disabled.
            As a result, I became even more withdrawn and distant from my family and friends, and my grades slipped further. 
            Nonetheless, this challenging time became a defining moment: I learned about survival and the skills necessary to ensure it.
            My empathic nature took root, bloomed, and grew, and being a faithful son in a time of need, I developed leadership.
