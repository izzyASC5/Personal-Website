<h2> The SAT Wiz</h2>
<p>
The SAT Wiz is the name of my tutoring company that I started during the summer of my 
junior year. In my 10th and 11th grade my teachers were ofter impressed with my skills in math and 
science and often asked me to help after school with kids who were stuggling in their classes. 
I loved helping people and the students that I helped showed extreme improvment in their classes. 
During the 11th grade I began to study for my SAT. I realized how difficult it was to study for these 
standardized test and wanted to help my friends. Soon after many people wanted me to help them study for their SAT
giving me the idea to create my company.
