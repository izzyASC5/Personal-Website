<h2  class="titles">Previous work experiances </h2>
<p class="text" id="Previous_jobs"> AllStar code and Code Next, NYC, where I had learned most 
   of my coding skills. Iâ€™ve always been passionate about studying medicine. Fascinated to learn all I can and to make a difference in my community, 
    I started volunteering/shadowing two local physicians, Dr. Fariwa, a community internist, and Dr. Yablichnokova, a community psychiatrist. 
    During one of my shadowing experiences, I met Ruthie, an 82 year old Iraqi-American female who lived alone and didn't have family to buy her groceries, 
    or take her to the doctor. During the COVID-19 pandemic, to help Ruthie and so many isolated seniors like her, as well as to strengthen my community, 
    I worked diligently with the two physicians I shadowed to establish call check ups on elderly and immigrant patients, who may not otherwise have the resources 
    to ask for help. Further, I established a neighborhood wellness check which triaged homebound and elderly neighbors and referred them to physicians as needed. 
    We also bought them groceries, food, and supplies. Since many of the local seniors were unfamiliar with using online meeting platforms, I set up a phone call-in 
    reading and discussion club to help alleviate their sense of isolation and positively impact their mental health. Recognizing that current social media platforms 
    are geared towards adults, filled with inappropriate R-rated themes, I created Good Vibes, a website designed to provide teens with a new social platform specifically 
    targeted to them. Good Vibes provides teenagers updates about COVID-19, and healthy outlets to share thoughts during the pandemic.
    Lastly, I organized neighborhood clean up projects to minimize airborne bacteria, thereby limiting spreading of disease.

<h2> The SAT Wiz</h2>
<p>
The SAT Wiz is the name of my tutoring company that I started during the summer of my
junior year to help teens develop their skills. I have a lot of experience tutoring many academic subjects. My 10th and 11th grade my teachers, 
    often impressed with my skills in social studies,math and
science, often asked me to tutor other students struggling in their classes.
I loved helping. All the students that I worked with showed extreme improvement in their classes.
During the 11th grade I began to study for my SAT. I realized how difficult it was to study for these
standardized tests, especially with so many COVID restrictions. I wanted to help. Before I knew it, many of my classmates were asking for my assistance, 
birthing the SAT Wiz.
